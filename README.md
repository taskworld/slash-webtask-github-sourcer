# slash-webtask-github-sourcer

Make [Slash Webtasks](https://webtask.io/slack) run code directly off GitHub.
This is done by making the webtask load the code from GitHub and evaluate it in webtaskâ€™s context.

- Allows Slash Webtasks to be version-controlled and collaboratively edited.

- Uses the GitHub Apps API, so it does not require a personal access token.
